			<p>Bitcoin is currently trading at $11,764. After the supposed bottom at $3150, Bitcoin has been rallying for many months. If Elliot waves is taken into consideration, and if Bitcoin is in the uptrend, then the rally has seen a 5 wave movement already. Following the rally of the 5th wave, the price may move down in an A-B-C trend. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) has also creeped into the overbought position. If the price sees a correction, the support levels are:
				<ol>
					<li>S1 - $8450</li>
					<li>S2 - $7450</li>
					<li>S3 - $6400</li>
				</ol>

			<li>Bitcoin/USD Weekly chart</li>
			<img src="C:\Users\megha\Desktop\CodeAtUni\Update 26 June\img\Bitcoin Weekly.png" width="700" height="350"/>
			<p>Considering the weekly chart of Bitcoin, the price has reached a 50% retracement, which is an important level of resistance considering the high of something $20,000 at the end of year 2017 and the low of $3150 in December 2018. A sell-off could be expected as the RSI on weekly chart also shows overbought. The uptrend is also not substantially supported by volume which is a not a good sign for the volume.

				<li>ETH/USD Daily Chart</li>
				<img src="C:\Users\megha\Desktop\CodeAtUni\Update 26 June\img\Ethereum Daily.png" width="700" height="350"/>
				<p>The current price of Ethereum is $315. Ethereum has the second largest market cap after Bitcoin, and it is termed as the next big thing in the blockchain domain. It is following a similar chart pattern as Bitcoin. ETH/USD has been in a good uptrend from its low of $83. From the daily chart, it seems ETH is approaching the 100-weekly Moving Average, an important level of resistance. Apart from that, it has hit the channel high as indicated in the chart. The 100-weekly MA average also coincides with the 23.6% Fib retracement level which is $375. This level of resistance was also seen in June and August of 2017. If the ETH price corrects from here then we may see it come down to following support levels:
				<ol>
					<li>S1 - $255</li>
					<li>S2 - $223</li>
					<li>S3 - $190</li>
				</ol></p>
